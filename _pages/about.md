Emily Black is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at New York University. Her research concerns fairness and accountability in AI systems. In other words, she creates methods to determine whether AI systems will cause harm to the public, studies the equity impacts of AI systems in high-stakes settings, such as the government, and connects her own and related research to the legal and policy worlds to help better regulate AI systems. Professor Black's work is interdisciplinary as she aims to prevent harm from AI systems used in a variety of contexts: she works with lawyers, accountants, civil society advocates, and others to try to prevent algorithmic harm in practice.
